When we began designing the technical architecture we wanted to use to build HearYe we ultimately decided to build our backend using Amazon Web Services. AWS appealed to us because it seemed like a service that would function and scale reliably and efficiently due to how many companies use it as their main platform (it’s actually absurd, the AWS customer base is [immense](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/all/). I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect from AWS since I had never used an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider.

The biggest lesson I learned during my first year and a half as a developer is that the best way to learn is by doing. The way I approached self-learning in the past involved learning everything about a certain tool/technology. When I was in junior high school I was fascinated by special effects in movies and attempted to learn Adobe After Effects in its entirety by reading Adobe After Effects For Dummies.

When I first signed on to AWS I was overwhelmed by everything I saw. AWS has an extensive [list of products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services#List_of_products) and I had no idea where to begin. Rather than reading the entire AWS documentation as my junior high school self probably would have attempted, I decided to briefly skim the purpose of different AWS products to plan my strategy. Once I decided which products I was interested in, I read the sections of the AWS documentation that corresponded to those products. This part of my strategy was a bit difficult since the AWS documentation isn’t exactly the best written reference guide out there. Consequently, I supplemented everything the documentation didn’t make clear by googling it, which usually led me to Stack Overflow posts. Chances are, if you’re stuck while coding or generally confused about a programming concept, someone has posted about it on Stack Overflow.

The big takeaway from this is that AWS is a massive service with tools for just about anything you need for developing your product. It’s overwhelming, especially for young developers. But if you’re patient and do a bit of reading up on the specific tools you need, there’s no reason why you should be intimidated by Amazon Web Services.
