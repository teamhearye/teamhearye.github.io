•	The HearYe Partnership Program with groups is now under way! We are proud to partner with Northwestern student groups and are excited that they are early adopters.
•	HearYe has begun integrating Amazon Web Services Lambda which expedites the request and response process and functions independently from a server, which will allow HearYe to take many requests without being overloaded.

•	A secure log-in system has now been integrated, and the event display feed is now in development!

•	Lastly, new marketing materials arrived! We have some awesome stickers, and look for us on [Dillo Day](http://dilloday.com) for surprise HearYe gear and swag!
