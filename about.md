[HearYe](http://www.hearye.io) is a mobile application that makes it easier for students to discover events that are happening on campus. This is a blog maintained by the team, which includes Drake and Max (Business and Sales), John, Brandon, and Navin (Development), and Yoko (Social Media).

We'll give you insight on the creative process of developing the product, the struggles we're facing, and a look into our company culture.

Thanks for stopping by.
