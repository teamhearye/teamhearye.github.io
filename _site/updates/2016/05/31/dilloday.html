<p>Every year Northwestern hosts the nation’s largest student-run music festival called “Dillo Day”. Founded in 1972, it takes place on the ‘lakefill’ area of campus, sitting right on Lake Michigan. To get onto the lakefill however, the students have to funnel through a checkpoint; we knew that this bottleneck was a perfect opportunity to promote HearYe. The logistical planning for our Dillo Day marketing campaign had been our minds several weeks prior to the event, but truly began once we convinced ourselves that it was a good idea to market without a product. After several debates about the possibility of marketing an idea without a product people can download and interact with, we settled on an idea: pass out customized bags with informational fliers inside. We also put a water bottle in each bag, as we knew that would be a major selling point (more on that later).</p>

<p>We bought 150 bags to distribute on Dillo Day, as well as a banner to place on the plastic folding table we borrowed from some friends. Because of the nature of Dillo Day, we thought we would not be able to obtain permits to set up a table “officially”. So, we just decided to pitch a table and give away bags until we were kicked out. With the event three days away, the planning was done.</p>

<p><img src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0J7L8Y14-F1D5PL0RF/pasted_image_at_2016_05_31_08_35_pm.png" alt="Hearye Bag" /></p>

<p>We woke up early on May 21st, packed the bags with fliers, stickers, and water before enjoying some of the morning’s tailgating festivities (shouts out to some groups for free food). We met at Max’s house at 1:30–where the bags, banners, and table were–and hauled the goods over to Sheridan and Foster. We set up the table faster than a NASCAR team changes wheels during a pit, and before we knew it, we were swarmed by people asking for bags. More importantly, however, was the fact that people were asking us about our product and what it was about. When we gave them the pitch, we knew they wanted it. The bags flew off the table, and in just 15 minutes we had given away all 150 of them. We dropped the table and banner of at Max’s house, then went to the lakefill to enjoy the annual music festival.</p>

<p>All in all, Dillo Day proved to be a fantastic day, and one of many small successes. The demand for HearYe was figuratively shown by the amount of people asking about what the product is about, and literally shown by the amount of orange bags seen walking around the lakefill. We also experienced a greater number of unique hits on our website throughout the following days, and saw increased interaction around the site as well. Additionally, we thought that we would be giving away bags for an hour and a half–not 15 minutes. The demand for the bags, and much more importantly, our product, was underestimated by our whole team. This validated the idea behind HearYe, and motivates us to build the best product possible in the coming months. Never underestimate the power of free materials to get people excited about your product.</p>
